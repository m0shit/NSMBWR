# NSMBWR
A simple randomizer for New Super Mario Bros. Wii.
# How to play
Download and install the latest version of Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Use whatever Wii iso extractor you want and extract NSMBW.

Open "randomizer.py".

Change the path present on line 17 to wherever your /Stage directory is located.

Open "music_randomizer.py".

Change the path present on line 17 to wherever your /stream directory is located. (e.g /Sound/stream)

Open "randomizer.bat" and wait for it to finish. Do the same with "music_randomizer.bat"

There should now be a backup folder in /Stage/Texture /Stage and /stream. (Original files before they were randomized)

Move /Stage back into /DATA/files and /stream back into /DATA/files/Sound.

Run the game! The levels and music should be shuffled!
